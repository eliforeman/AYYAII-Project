Abstract

Music is an art that can be enjoyed at any point in one’s life. However, what makes music “appealing” to us and unique? In this paper, this question guides our research and conclusion. In order to determine what makes a piece of music unique, we utilize the state-of-the-art machine learning platform TensorFlow and its music manipulation library-Magenta. Magenta helps artist and software engineers generate art and music. We researched the underpinnings of Magenta and created our own MIDI manipulation model called Lilac. Using Magenta’s built in data structures, we were able to figure out what makes certain songs unique.
